/**
 * A class for deploying and calling methods on a Sale.
 * @remarks
 *
 * This class provides an easy way to deploy Sales using Rain's canonical factories, and methods for interacting with an already deployed Sale.
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { Sale } from 'rain-sdk'
 * // To deploy a new Sale, pass an ethers.js Signer, the chainId and the config for the Sale.
 * const newSale = await Sale.deploy(signer, chainId, {_config, saleRedeemableERC20Config_})
 *
 * // To connect to an existing Sale just pass the address and an ethers.js Signer.
 * const existingSale = new Sale(address, signer)
 *
 * // Once you have a Sale, you can call the smart contract methods:
 * await existingSale.start()
 * await existingSale.buy(config_)
 * ```
 *
